this is the arduino code for my smart lock IOT project
It is basically fetches the configured passcode from python flask
and lets the user log in with a passcode, through comparing the two passcodes 
entered and configured. Also it sends motion at the doorbell using ultrasonic sensor, to python flask and sql database.
